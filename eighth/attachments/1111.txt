In each trial, the mole rats started out in their nest, went to the food source and then had to find their way back home, back to the nest.\nTo determine which navigation system they were using, the researchers tested the animals under two different conditions.\nFirst, the mole rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the trip to the food and the trip home. And under these normal conditions, they all followed their original route back home, regardless of the length of the trip to the food source. \nThen in the second part of the experiment, the magnetic field was altered but only for the trip home, a specially constructed set of magnets was used to shift the magnetic field around the habitat 19 degrees eastward. The researchers wanted to see how the mole rats responded to this shift. Well, it turns out that the magnetic shift had no impact on the return route of the blind mole rats after a short trip. They returned to the point where they had started from.\nBut after a longer trip, they took a totally different route: one that led them nine degrees east of the nest. Essentially they got lost. This was strong evidence that blind mole rats use magnetic navigation only for longer trips.\nSo why two navigation systems: one for long trips and one for short trips?\nWell, for now we can only speculate, but we think that when mole rats rely on the first system, using underground landmarks or their sense of time, well, they make small mistakes here and there. On a short trip, this doesn&#39;t matter much. The trip is short, so they can&#39;t make many mistakes.\nBut on a long trip, well, there are lots of opportunities to make small mistakes, and small mistakes can add up, leading the mole rat far from where it wants to be. So on a long trip, a magnetic navigation system is better, more useful, since earth&#39;s magnetic field is stable, a constant, a more reliable indicator of direction!\n&quot;,&quot;_clauseText&quot;:&quot;Now, with their bicycle wheel tunnel system the researchers were able to vary the distance that the mole rats travel between their nest and their food source by creating long routes and short routes.\n In each trial, the mole rats started out in their nest, went to the food source and then had to find their way back home, back to the nest.\nTo determine which navigation system they were using, the researchers tested the animals under two different conditions.\nFirst, the mole rats were tested under conditions of normal magnetism for both the trip to the food and the trip home. \nAnd under these normal conditions, they all followed their original route back home, regardless of the length of the trip to the food source. \nThen in the second part of the experiment, the magnetic field was altered but only for the trip home, a specially constructed set of magnets was used to shift the magnetic field around the habitat 19 degrees eastward. \nThe researchers wanted to see how the mole rats responded to this shift. \nWell, it turns out that the magnetic shift had no impact on the return route of the blind mole rats after a short trip. \nThey returned to the point where they had started from.\nBut after a longer trip, they took a totally different route: one that led them nine degrees east of the nest.
